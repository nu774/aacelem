aacelem - tiny tool to pull specific channel element from ADTS LC-AAC stream
=============================================================================

usage
-----
aacelem -a INFILE
  Scan INFILE and show channel elements in it, such as SCE, CPE, or LFE.
  SCE means single channel element, used for mono or center channel.
  CPE means channel pair element, which contains stereo channels.
  Since INFILE can contains multiple parts with different channel settings,
  -a will scan whole input. If you are sure that input doesn't contain
  such parts or you just want to see first elements, just type CTRL-C and
  kill aacelem.

aacelem INFILE N1:OUTFILE1 [N2:OUTFILE2..]  
  N1,N2.. are positions of channel element to select (starting with 1).
  Each specified channel element is written into OUTFILE
  in the form of ADTS stream.

example
-------
aacelem 5.1ch.aac 1:C.aac 2:LR.aac
  This command line will output first channel element(SCE) into C.aac
  and second chanel element(CPE) into LR.aac.

aacelem dual-mono.aac 1:out.aac
  This will output first mono channel in dual-mono source into out.aac.
